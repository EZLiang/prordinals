# Prordinals
A collection of programs with high ordinals

## What's this?
An [ordinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number) is a certain extension of the natural numbers to include infinite ones.

We can assign ordinals to programs as follows. We assign each program the smallest ordinal greater than the ordinals of all programs it prints out.

So, a program that does nothing would have an ordinal of zero, one that prints that program would be a value of 1, a program that prints that program has a value of two, and so on. A program printing those in order would have a value of w.
